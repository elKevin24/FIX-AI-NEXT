ReferenceError: module is not defined in ES module scope
This file is being treated as an ES module because it has a '.js' file extension and '/home/kev/Documentos/GitHub/FIX-AI-NEXT/package.json' contains "type": "module". To treat it as a CommonJS script, rename it to use the '.cjs' file extension.
